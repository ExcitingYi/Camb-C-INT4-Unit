## Code of Camb-C (Still under construction)
syn: RTL, DC synthesis, P&R and corresponding report files. 
alg: simulator based on DNNWeaver.

Released the design of R29_INT4, MAC_INT4.
Other code is coming soon.....

Note: the power report in this repo is better than that in paper Cambricon-C.
Now, R29_INT4 is more than 2x better than MAC_INT4. Besides, for R29, the frequency can reach about 1.14GHz, and MAC_INT4 can run at about 1GHz.

The complete project code will be released by the spring festival, if sucessful. (of which year? lolðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)
